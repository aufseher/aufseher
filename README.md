hi i made this account because sometimes i get bored and i wanna be dressed as the ponytown wiki's mascot and i need a link for my fandom account.

spam follows usually aren't followed back since i rarely use this account. everything you need is on my main account ok? ok

i didn't actually make this account recently, i found it by digging through my emails. 2019 is insane.
